A set of offsetting factors, including the already high base, declining global commodity prices, and the recent decline in the month-on-month trajectory, have the potential to reduce inflation. However, assumptions of depreciation under the reform scenario may contribute an immediate 5 to 7 percentage points to inflation. The net effect of these factors is expected to take inflation to the high 30s in the second half of 2023. However, a firm downward trend is anticipated afterward as central bank financing to the government decreases and reform policies address supply-side reforms. Based on these assumptions, inflation is expected to fall to just below 20 percent by June 2024."
