        "description": "The latest data reveals a significant shift in import trends, as the total merchandise import bill has reached USD 18.1 billion, indicating a substantial 26.6 percent annual growth. This surge can be attributed to increased import bills of consumer goods, fuel, and semi-finished goods. However, payments for capital goods, raw materials, and miscellaneous goods have experienced a decline. Consequently, the import-to-GDP ratio has risen to 14.3 percent, compared to 12.8 percent recorded a year ago.",
